                    <h3>Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Results and Executive Summary</h3>
                    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
                    <p>This report presents the findings from a penetration test conducted on the website <a href="http://zero.webappsecurity.com/" target="_blank">http://zero.webappsecurity.com/</a>. The test aimed to identify web application vulnerabilities, assess compliance with security standards such as GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001, and provide recommendations to mitigate identified risks. The evaluation involved automated and manual testing methodologies to reflect real-world attack scenarios.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary of Work Carried Out:</strong></p>
                    <p>The penetration test involved the following steps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Preliminary Scans:</strong> Tools like Traceroute, Dig, and Nslookup were used to gather initial data on network paths and DNS configurations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Main Scans:</strong> Nmap was employed to identify open ports and services, while OWASP ZAP was used to detect application layer vulnerabilities.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Methodology:</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Traceroute:</strong> Used to identify network latency and potential points of failure. It helps in understanding the path data takes from the source to the destination.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dig:</strong> Utilized to query DNS servers for information about host addresses, mail exchanges, name servers, etc., to diagnose DNS issues including spoofing and misconfigurations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nslookup:</strong> Employed to verify DNS records and diagnose domain resolution issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nmap:</strong> A comprehensive port scanning tool used to identify open ports and services, providing a detailed view of the network's security posture.</li>
                        <li><strong>OWASP ZAP:</strong> A powerful tool for detecting a wide range of application vulnerabilities, including SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Limitations Encountered:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Network Path Changes:</strong> The path that data takes across the network can change, which may affect consistency in Traceroute results.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scope of Tools:</strong> The tools used primarily diagnose network and DNS issues but may not cover all possible web application vulnerabilities.</li>
                    </ul>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Evaluation Against Security Standards:</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>GDPR Compliance:</strong> The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates the protection of personal data. This website's current security posture, particularly the lack of SSL/TLS encryption, fails to meet GDPR requirements, exposing user data to potential breaches during transmission (European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, 2021).</p>
                    <p><strong>ISO/IEC 27001 Compliance:</strong> ISO/IEC 27001 provides a framework for managing information security. The website's deficiencies in DNS management and lack of encrypted data transmission fall short of this standard (International Organization for Standardization, 2013).</p>

                    <p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>
                    <p>The penetration test revealed significant security vulnerabilities, particularly in data transmission and DNS configurations. The absence of SSL/TLS encryption and DNSSEC are critical weaknesses, compromising both data security and GDPR compliance. These vulnerabilities expose sensitive user data to interception and manipulation, posing a significant risk to the organization. Immediate remediation is essential to enhance the website's security posture and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory standards.</p>
                    <p>Implementing SSL/TLS (HTTPS) is crucial to encrypt data in transit, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring GDPR compliance. Similarly, deploying DNSSEC will safeguard DNS responses from tampering and spoofing, thereby enhancing the integrity and authenticity of DNS information. Regular monitoring of network latency, updating DNS records, securing open ports, implementing anti-CSRF tokens, and conducting regular security audits are vital steps to maintain a robust security framework and mitigate potential risks.</p>

                    <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
