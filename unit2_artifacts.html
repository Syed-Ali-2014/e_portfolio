                    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
                    <p>Based on the information identified about your assigned websites, carry out a literature search/ audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities database to create a baseline audit on potential vulnerabilities with websites.</p>

                    <p><strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify and analyse security threats and vulnerabilities in network systems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them.</li>
                        <li>Design and critically appraise computer programs and systems to produce solutions that help manage and audit risk and security issues.</li>
                        <li>Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts and warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
                    <p>Reflect on this activity by answering the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Did you have any issues or challenges with the literature search/audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities database?</li>
                        <li>How did you overcome them?</li>
                        <li>How will they affect your final report?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Record all reflections in your e-portfolio. Find guidance on creating a GitHub account and e-Portfolio in the Module Resources tab.</p>

                    <h3>Assigned Website</h3>
                    <p><a href="http://zero.webappsecurity.com/" target="_blank">http://zero.webappsecurity.com/</a></p>
                    
                    <h3>Analysis and Responses</h3>
                    <p><strong>Question 1: Did you have any issues or challenges with the literature search/audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities database?</strong></p>
                    <p>Answer: One of the primary challenges encountered during the literature search was the vast amount of data available, making it difficult to filter out the most relevant information. Additionally, navigating through different databases and ensuring the accuracy of the information required a meticulous approach. Another challenge was identifying and verifying the credibility of various sources, which required cross-referencing multiple sources to ensure consistency.</p>

                    <p><strong>Question 2: How did you overcome them?</strong></p>
                    <p>Answer: To overcome these challenges, I developed a systematic approach to the literature search. This included setting clear criteria for selecting sources, such as prioritizing peer-reviewed journals and reputable security websites. I also used advanced search techniques, such as Boolean operators, to narrow down the search results. Cross-referencing information from multiple sources helped in verifying the accuracy and credibility of the data. Additionally, keeping detailed notes and organizing the information into categories made it easier to analyze and synthesize the findings.</p>

                    <p><strong>Question 3: How will they affect your final report?</strong></p>
                    <p>Answer: The challenges and the methods employed to overcome them will enhance the quality of the final report. The systematic approach to the literature search ensures that the information included in the report is relevant, accurate, and credible. The detailed notes and organized data will facilitate a comprehensive analysis, leading to well-informed conclusions and recommendations. This thorough approach will also add depth to the vulnerability analysis, providing a solid foundation for the baseline audit and subsequent evaluations.</p>

                    <h3>Baseline Audit on Potential Vulnerabilities</h3>
                    <p>Based on the information identified from the literature search and the national vulnerabilities database, the following vulnerabilities were confirmed for the website <a href="http://zero.webappsecurity.com/" target="_blank">http://zero.webappsecurity.com/</a>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lack of SSL (HTTPS):</strong> The website uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Outdated Software Components:</strong> Several software components used by the website are outdated, which could be exploited by attackers. For example, the version of jQuery used is outdated and has known vulnerabilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> The website is susceptible to SQL injection attacks due to improper validation of user inputs. This was confirmed using tools like SQLMap.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> The site has XSS vulnerabilities where attackers can inject malicious scripts, confirmed through manual testing and tools like OWASP ZAP.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weak Authentication Mechanisms:</strong> The authentication mechanisms in place are not robust enough to prevent unauthorized access. This was verified through password strength analysis and lack of multi-factor authentication.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This baseline audit serves as a foundation for further in-depth vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the website's security posture.</p>
