                                Case studies help generate hypotheses but are not ideal for generalizing findings due to
                                sample limitations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus Groups:</strong> Small groups are selected to discuss specific topics,
                                helping to gain insights on the “why” behind behaviors and opinions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quantitative Observations:</strong> Observing numerical values and applying
                                statistical methods to analyze the data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Qualitative Observations:</strong> Monitoring and observing characteristics in

                            <li><strong>Questionnaires:</strong> A set of questions used in both qualitative and
                                quantitative research for gathering information, often part of a survey but can also be
                                used independently.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pre-testing and Post-testing:</strong> Techniques used before and after

                            variables, which are measured and analyzed using statistical and graphical techniques. The
                            focus was on:
