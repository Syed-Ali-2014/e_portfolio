                    <h3>Reflective Piece</h3>

                    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
                    <p>This module on network security has been a transformative journey, offering invaluable insights into the legal, social, ethical, and professional challenges faced by information security and risk professionals. By engaging in various activities, discussions, and assignments, I have developed a deeper understanding of these issues and honed essential professional skills. This reflective piece follows the Rolfe et al.â€™s (2001) framework, addressing what I have learned, its significance, and how I plan to apply this knowledge in the future.</p>

                    <p><strong>What?</strong></p>
                    <p>The module covered a broad spectrum of topics, including the history of network security, advanced persistent threats, vulnerability assessments, breach analysis, and future trends like generative AI. The primary learning outcomes were to identify and analyze security threats, apply appropriate methodologies and tools, design solutions to manage risks, and ensure compliance with legal standards like GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001.</p>

                    <p>One of the critical incidents was the penetration test conducted on the website <a href="http://zero.webappsecurity.com/" target="_blank">http://zero.webappsecurity.com/</a>, which highlighted significant vulnerabilities, including the lack of SSL/TLS encryption and DNSSEC. This exercise reinforced the importance of thorough security assessments and continuous monitoring to mitigate risks.</p>

                    <p>Another critical learning experience was the Solar Winds Breach case study. This case study provided a real-world example of an advanced persistent threat (APT) and how such threats can compromise even the most secure networks. Analyzing the breach helped me understand the complexity of modern cyber-attacks and the importance of a comprehensive security strategy.</p>

                    <p>The collaborative discussion on logging for security analysis was another significant component of the module. It highlighted the dual role of logging as both a crucial security measure and a potential vulnerability. By examining log tampering and injection risks, I learned how to secure log data while maintaining its utility for forensic investigations.</p>

                    <p><strong>So What?</strong></p>
                    <p>Understanding these vulnerabilities and the associated risks was eye-opening. The absence of SSL/TLS, for instance, exposed user data to potential interception, a clear violation of GDPR requirements (European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, 2021). This realization underscored the legal and ethical responsibilities of cybersecurity professionals to protect sensitive information.</p>

                    <p>The Solar Winds Breach case study was particularly impactful. It demonstrated how sophisticated APTs could infiltrate secure networks and remain undetected for extended periods. This case study emphasized the need for continuous monitoring, advanced detection techniques, and robust incident response plans.</p>

                    <p>The module also emphasized the importance of collaboration and communication. Through peer discussions and feedback sessions, I learned the value of sharing knowledge and gaining different perspectives. For instance, the collaborative discussions on logging and its security implications provided diverse viewpoints that enriched my understanding and approach to security issues.</p>

                    <p>Feedback from peers and tutors was crucial in refining my approach and ensuring the accuracy of my work. Constructive criticism on my vulnerability assessment report helped me improve my analysis and presentation skills, aligning my work with professional standards. Additionally, engaging in collaborative discussions helped me appreciate different viewpoints, enhancing my critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>

                    <p>The ethical considerations of cybersecurity were another significant area of focus. Issues like data privacy, the ethical implications of security breaches, and the professional responsibility to protect user data were discussed in depth. This has made me more aware of the ethical dimensions of my role as a cybersecurity professional.</p>

                    <p><strong>Now What?</strong></p>
                    <p>Moving forward, I plan to apply the knowledge and skills gained from this module in several ways. Firstly, I will ensure that any web application I work on implements robust security measures, including SSL/TLS and DNSSEC, to comply with legal standards and protect user data. Regular security audits and updates will be a priority to maintain a strong security posture.</p>

                    <p>Secondly, I aim to continue enhancing my professional skills through continuous learning and practical application. Time management and critical thinking were essential skills developed during this module, and I plan to apply these in managing future projects efficiently. Engaging in further research and staying updated with the latest trends in cybersecurity will also be a focus area.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, I will place a greater emphasis on ethical considerations in all my professional activities. Ensuring that user data is protected and that all actions comply with legal and ethical standards will be paramount. I will also advocate for and implement best practices in cybersecurity within my organization, sharing knowledge and strategies to enhance overall security.</p>

                    <p>To ensure continuous professional development, I have created a PDP focusing on the following areas:</p>
