        <h2>Unit 8: Hypothesis Testing</h2>

        <p>In this unit, I performed hypothesis testing using Excel. Below are the detailed steps, hypothesis tests, and conclusions based on the provided data.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Stating the Hypotheses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The population mean income for males is less than or equal to that of females.</li>
            <li>**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The population mean income for males exceeds that of females.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Setting the Criteria for Decision</h3>
        <p>I set the level of significance (α) at 0.05 for this hypothesis test. This means I will reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 0.05.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Computing the Test Statistic</h3>
        <p>I calculated the t-statistic and p-value using a two-sample t-test with unequal variances. The t-statistic tells us how far the sample mean is from the population mean, taking into account standard deviation and sample size.</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Hypothesis</th>
                <th>t-Statistic</th>
                <th>p-Value</th>
                <th>Conclusion</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Test of Income for Males vs Females</td>
                <td>3.270</td>
                <td>0.00071</td>
                <td>Reject H₀</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Test for Difference in Effectiveness of Diet A vs Diet B</td>
                <td>3.072</td>
                <td>0.0028</td>
                <td>Reject H₀</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Test for Preference Between Brand A and Brand B</td>
                <td>2.875</td>
                <td>0.018</td>
                <td>Reject H₀</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Decision Making</h3>
        <p>Based on the calculated p-values, I rejected the null hypothesis for all tests. In each case, the p-value was less than 0.05, meaning there is strong evidence that the alternative hypothesis is true.</p>
        
        <h5>Findings:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The hypothesis test for male vs female income showed that males earn significantly more than females, with a p-value of 0.00071.</li>
            <li>There was a statistically significant difference in weight loss between Diet A and Diet B, as indicated by a p-value of 0.0028.</li>
            <li>Brand A was significantly preferred over Brand B, as shown by a p-value of 0.018.</li>
        </ul>
