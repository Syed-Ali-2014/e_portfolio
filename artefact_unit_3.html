                    </header>
                    <p>This artefact outlines the research methods and data collection plan for my chosen topic: **Cloud Security Risks in the Health Sector**. The artefact highlights the most suitable methods for the research and the necessary skills I need to develop.</p>

                    <h4>1. Which Research Methods Will Suit My Purpose?</h4>
                    <p>
                        For my project on cloud security risks in the health sector, a **mixed methods approach** would be the most appropriate. This will allow me to combine both qualitative and quantitative data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the cloud security challenges faced by healthcare organizations.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Qualitative Methods:</strong> These will help gather insights from healthcare professionals about their experiences with cloud security, challenges they face, and strategies they use to mitigate risks. This will be achieved through semi-structured interviews and case studies of healthcare institutions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quantitative Methods:</strong> Quantitative data will be collected to measure the frequency and severity of cloud security incidents, particularly focusing on data breaches, insider threats, and system failures. Surveys and secondary data analysis from existing cloud security reports will be used for this purpose.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. Data Collection Methods to Consider</h4>
                    <p>
                        To ensure that the project is grounded in both theoretical and practical knowledge, the following data collection methods will be employed:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> Conducting interviews with IT security professionals and cloud service providers in healthcare. These interviews will help identify the most common cloud security risks and how they are managed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Surveys:</strong> Online surveys targeting healthcare organizations to gather data about their use of cloud computing and security challenges they face.</li>
                        <li><strong>Case Studies:</strong> Analyzing real-world incidents of cloud security breaches in healthcare. This will provide contextual examples of security failures and successful mitigation strategies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secondary Data Analysis:</strong> Using existing industry reports and statistical data on cloud security incidents in healthcare to provide context and support for the findings from primary data.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>3. Required Skills for This Project</h4>
                    <p>
                        The project will require a combination of technical and analytical skills. Here are the key skills I will need to develop or refine:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Proficiency in analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data, including using tools such as Excel, Python, or R for data manipulation and visualization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cybersecurity Knowledge:</strong> A solid understanding of cloud security protocols, including encryption, identity access management (IAM), and multi-factor authentication (MFA), will be essential for interpreting the results.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interviewing Skills:</strong> Developing strong interviewing techniques to ensure that the qualitative data collected from professionals is meaningful and relevant.</li>
                        <li><strong>Research Skills:</strong> Ability to critically analyze and review existing literature and reports on cloud security risks, extracting relevant insights and supporting evidence.</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication Skills:</strong> Clear and effective communication will be necessary for presenting the findings of the research both in written and oral formats.</li>
                    </ul>
