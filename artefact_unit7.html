        <h2>Unit 7: Hypothesis Testing Using Excel and Summary Measures</h2>

        <p>In this unit, I learned how to perform hypothesis testing using Excel's built-in functions. Below are the details of the hypothesis tests conducted, along with the calculations and results.</p>
        
        <h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3>
        <p>Here are the key hypothesis tests I conducted using the t-Test functions in Excel:</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Hypothesis</th>
                <th>t-Statistic</th>
                <th>p-Value</th>
                <th>Conclusion</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Test of Difference between Con1 and Con2</td>
                <td>2.875</td>
                <td>0.018</td>
                <td>Reject H0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Test of Difference between Filter Agent 1 and Filter Agent 2 (One-tailed)</td>
                <td>1.940</td>
                <td>0.03</td>
                <td>Reject H0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Test of Population Mean Income for Males vs Females</td>
                <td>3.270</td>
                <td>0.00071</td>
                <td>Reject H0</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h5>Findings:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The test between Con1 and Con2 showed significant differences, with a p-value of 0.018, rejecting the null hypothesis.</li>
            <li>Filter Agent 1 is significantly more effective than Filter Agent 2, as indicated by the rejection of H0 with a p-value of 0.03.</li>
            <li>Males earn significantly more than females in the given population, with a p-value of 0.00071, showing strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Summary Measures</h3>
        
        <p>For the summary measures, I calculated various descriptive statistics, including the mean and standard deviation for the weight loss data from Diet A and Diet B.</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Measure</th>
                <th>Diet A</th>
                <th>Diet B</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sample Size (n)</td>
                <td>100</td>
                <td>100</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mean Weight Loss (kg)</td>
                <td>5.341</td>
                <td>3.710</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Standard Deviation (kg)</td>
                <td>2.536</td>
                <td>3.285</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <div class="interpretation">
            <h5>Interpretation:</h5>
            <p>Based on the summary measures, Diet A appears to have been more effective in promoting weight loss compared to Diet B. The mean weight loss for Diet A was higher than that for Diet B, and a majority of the individuals who undertook Diet A experienced positive weight loss results.</p>
